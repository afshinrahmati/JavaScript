// static-type ==> ensuring that variables are used with the correct types.is done at compile time rather than at runtime
// Example Languages: C, C++, Java, Go, Rust.
// Type Checking: In static programming, type checking occurs during compilation, while in dynamic programming, it happens during runtime.
//  Dynamic Programming (Dynamically Typed Languages):
// Dynamic programming refers to the use of dynamically typed languages, where type checking is performed at runtime.
// Example Languages: Python, JavaScript, Ruby, PHP.

number = 5       // # number is an int
number = "Hello"  //# now number is a string, no issue at runtime
