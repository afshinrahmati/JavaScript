//In JavaScript, a Promise is an object that represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.
// Promises provide a way to handle asynchronous code,
// making it easier to work with operations that don't return results immediately, such as network requests, file reading, or timers.
